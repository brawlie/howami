Welcome to brawlstars-how am i api. Sometimes you ask yourself why are you still alive, but why don't you just pick a random object from this api and see what you got ? May be the reason why you're still alive. By the way, we're making this project just for fun. Some may be a little confusing, so to improve that we need your help by contributing this repository. Note : Everyone is welcome to contribute as long as you know brawlstars, lmao
